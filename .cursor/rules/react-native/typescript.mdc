# Typescript rules

## TypeScript
- Prefer types over interfaces.
- Avoid enums; use const objects with 'as const'.
- Use explicit return types for all functions.
- Avoid type assertions with 'as' or '!' operators unless absolutely necessary
- Use mapped and conditional types for advanced type transformations
- If a type is being reused within different files extract it for reuse
- Use strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety
- Avoid using `any`; strive for precise types.
